## Versioning Convention

The versioning convention used in this repository follows the format `v.x.y.z`, where:

- `x`: Major version (increments for significant changes that may introduce backward incompatibilities).

- `z`: Patch version (increments for bug fixes or patches that don't affect backward compatibility).

For example, a version tag could be `v1.2.0` for a major version 1, minor version 2, and patch version 0.

Please ensure that your branches and commits follow these guidelines for consistency and clarity.
