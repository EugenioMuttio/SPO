        RC20: Three-bar truss design problem
        This optimization problem is taken from civil engineering, and has
        an accidented constrained space. The main objective of this problem
        is to minimize the weight of the bar structures. The constraints of this
        problem are based on the stress constraints of each bar. The resultant
        problem has linear objective function with three non-linear constraints.
